					<h3>Music Genre Belief Recognition</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This was the major project for the course CS543: Massive Data Storage and Retrieval. The aim of the project was to be able to predict genre of a song with time sequencing. It was conceptualized and modelled with the help of spectrograms, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks (later replaced by time-distributed layers to improve upon accuracy). Finally, the model was deployed and visualized on web by using TensorflowJS front-end development. <b>Tech used: Python, TensorflowJS, Keras, JavaScript, HTML, CSS</b><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-13hnVhA0"><b>Demo</b></a></p>

					<h3>Live Transcription of Sign Language using Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This project was my Bachelor Thesis project and my introduction to the world of convolutional neural networks. The aim of the project was to deploy a webcam based user interface which could predict the sign language in real time. The core of the model is a CNN architecture, trained on a dataset of ~0.17 million images, achieving an accuracy of 97%. The github repo is kind of unstructured, which needs to be updated soon. <b>Tech used: Python, TensorflowJS, Keras, OpenCV</b></p>

					<h3>Gravitational Search Algorithm in Recommendation Systems</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Project of many firsts. First Published paper - First International Conference - First Research experience. The motivation that stemmed the conceptualization of this paper was along the lines of fusing computational intelligence techniques with Collaborative filtering methods. It explored a relatively new bio-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm named Gravitational Search Algorithm(GSA) for the purpose of recommending jokes to users. Later, I presented the paper in the 8th International Conference on Swarm Intelligence, Fukuoka, Japan. </p>

					<h3>Tackling TSP with Ant Colony Optimization and Visualization</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Final project for CS512:Data Structures and Algorithms. The traveling salesman problem was tackled with the help of a nature inspired technique called ant colony Optimization. The project models the probabilistic behavior of pheromone chemical interactions between ants while foraging for food. A simple user interface was also created to allow the user to play with the number of ants and steps the program should be run for. The final output was a visualization of the order of cities to be traveled so as to cover the least distance possible.</p>

					<h3>Recommendation Systems</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Some of the basic and intermediate level work I did on recommendation systems before starting research work on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-61833-3_63">my paper</a> in my undergraduate days. Implementing song recommendation system based on popularity and items, movie recommendation system using Collaborative filtering with Particle Swarm Optimization (which later was a comparison algorithm for the paper)</p>
