Hi, I am Vedant Choudhary. Currently, I am a graduate student at Rutgers University - New Brunswick pursuing MS in Computer Science with specialization in Data Science. I have my undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, University of Delhi. I bring with me a good mix of industrial and research knowledge. I have worked on a graph based deep learning architecture and BERT models for a major pharma client as part of my Summer 2019 internship at Genpact LLC. Before graduate studies, I worked as a Data Analyst for a year, working with massive data and providing analysis and insights to a major UK retail giant, increasing their annual revenue by 20 million pounds. I like to work with anything and everything related to the fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science. And to keep up with the pace of these fields, I spend a good time reading new research papers, participating in Kaggle competitions and working on personal projects. My research interests lie towards application based deep learning and recommendation systems.
This website is a medium for me to share my projects and experiences through my Master's journey and beyond.

In my free time, I like to go for swimming, play guitar, explore new music, or if I feel like being glued to my laptop, I like to read about the ongoing research in AI. I am also into photography, and if interested, you can check out my <a href="https://unsplash.com/@vedantc6"> Unsplash account </a>.
