Hi, I am Vedant Choudhary. I am a graduate student at Rutgers University - New Brunswick pursuing Data Science concentration in the CS department. I have my undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, University of Delhi. I have a year worth of industrial experience in working with massive data and providing analysis and insights to a major UK retail giant, increasing their annual revenue by 20 million pounds. I am pretty comfortable with machine learning and data science topics, due to the various projects I have implemented and through the Kaggle competitions I take part in frequently. I like to read and implement research papers in these fields, some of the latest ones are in sequential GANs and storytelling.
This website is a medium for me to share my projects and experiences through my Master's journey.

In my free time, I like to go for swimming, play guitar, explore new music, or if I feel like being glued to my laptop, I like to read about the ongoing research in AI. I am also into photography, and if interested, you can check out my <a href="https://unsplash.com/@vedantc6"> Unsplash account </a>.
