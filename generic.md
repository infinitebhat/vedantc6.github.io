Hi, welcome to my personal website. Originally from New Delhi, I am currently pursuing MS in Data Science (CS department) from School of Arts and Sciences, Rutgers University - The State University of New Jersey. I have been working with data from the junior year of my undergraduate college (Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi, India). After graduating, I worked as a data analyst in The Smart Cube for a year before pursuing MS. In my free time, I like to play guitar, explore new music, read research papers and articles on latest advancements in AI/ML domain.
