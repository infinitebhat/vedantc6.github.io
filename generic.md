Hi, I am Vedant Choudhary. I am currently pursuing MS in Data Science (CS department) from School of Arts and Sciences, Rutgers University - The State University of New Jersey. I have my undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, University of Delhi. It was towards the end of my sophomore year and through a non technical project that I got to know what Machine Learning is and how it could be applied to that project. Ever since then, I have been gathering knowledge and experience in the domain of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Science. This website is a medium for me to share my projects and experiences through my Master's journey.

In my free time, I like to go for swimming, play guitar, explore new music, or if I feel like being glued to my laptop, I like to read about the ongoing research in AI. I am also into photography, and if interested, you can check out my <a href="https://unsplash.com/@vedantc6"> Unsplash account </a>.
